    <h2>B.L.A.C.K. Light</h2>
    <h4>Backstory</h4>
  </head>
  <body>
    The year is 2035. Machines and humans coexist in this universe. Some would even say Science has gone too far, as even genetically modified human/animal hybrids exist and science and magic coexist as well. There are 2 rival factions in America, the B.L.A.C.K. Light, a police force with a diverse cast, grey morals, but overall sense of justice, and the R.E.D. A shady government run by a corrupt royal family.
